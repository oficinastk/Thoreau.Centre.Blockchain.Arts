# Thoreau Centre for the Blockchain Arts

The Thoreau Centre for the Blockchain Arts (TCBA) is a space dedicated to the promotion of art on the blockchain, that exists as a webpage with the full catalogue, and Virtual Reality spaces built on both Voxels (former CryptoVoxels) and Decentraland that display curated pieces from the collection.

The webpage is hosted by github but efforts are currently being made to publish it on the IPFS to ensure (some) resilience and censorship resistance.

On Decentraland the building was implemented on an estate (32,54) provided 'rent free' by the Anarchists INTL District. The parcels on Voxels (#855 and #967) are owned by me (oficinas tk)

Aligned with the distric guidelines [â’¶ 20.52](https://github.com/decentraland/districts/issues/18), the admitance of visitors to the TCBA will never be gated and no fees will be charged to artists seeking to display their work.


# Goals

It is in its imediate goals to promote regular exhibitions of old and new work by artists on the blockchain, as well as to arrange for a permanent exhibition of 'historical' blockchain art (Rare Pepes, Cryptopunks, etc) to document these early manifestations.

# TCBA DCL, TCBA Embassy and TCBA Collection

TCBA DCL can be visited on [Decentraland](https://play.decentraland.org/?realm=dg&position=33%2C54&island=I4u50)

The TCBA Embassy and TCBA Collection were built on [Voxels](https://cryptovoxels.com) and serve as a bridge between metaverses, as well as to raise awareness about the TCBA and to display its collection. They are placed at [1, Monad Court](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/967) and at [1, Poly Troughway](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/855), in Little Tokyo just on the outskirts of the budding Arts District.

# The name

Henry David Thoreau was a north american writer whose ideas revolved around the concept of 'self reliance' and as this is a personal project by [Oficinas TK](https://oficinastk.github.io) (a one man crew with a 'no budget' approach) it seemed adequate to honour him.
