## TCBA collection

TCBA's(1) purpose is to promote the blockchain arts(2) with the ultimate goal of making their creators more visible to a wider audience, and hopefully make new bridges between artists, lovers and collectors.

Two approaches define the core of TCBA's activity:

1. To expand artists visibility by building a collection that can be seen by the general public, anywhere in the world, either by visiting the Virtual Reality worlds of Decentraland(3) and Cryptovoxels(4), or by just browsing an online catalogue(5) of the works. 

2. To introduce new artists to the ecosystem, and by extension, to potential new collectors, lovers and artists.



------------------
1- It is important to remark that the TCBA is a conceptual institution, a temporary autonomous zone created as an extension of the artistic concerns of Oficinas TK; hardly an institution in the traditional sense.

2- By blockchain arts (which is a somewhat controversial term), I mean **original art** that has been **attached to some form of 'digital certification of origin'**. For ex. smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that mint ERC721 tokens, as the ones used by platforms like Known Origin, Super Rare, Makersplace, Mokens, Digital Art Chain and Artists Liberation Front, among others.

3- [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/](https://play.decentraland.org/?realm=dg&position=33%2C54&island=I4u50)

4- [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/](https://www.voxels.com/parcels/855)

**CAVEAT** - The TCBA is not really an institution, it's just me. This, by extent, also means that **all the pieces in the collection are mine** since I have the private keys of TCBA's collection ETH Wallet. I will take all the measures to make sure the collection remains public, online and safe (**The pieces are cold stored in a Trezor One hardware wallet, graciously donated by [Trezor](https://trezor.io/)**)
