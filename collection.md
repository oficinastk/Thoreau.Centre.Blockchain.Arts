## TCBA collection

TCBA's(1) purpose is to promote the blockchain arts(2) with the ultimate goal of making their creators more visible to a wider audience, and hopefully make new bridges between artists, lovers and collectors.


Two approaches define the core of TCBA's activity:


1. To expand artists visibility by building a collection that can be seen by the general public, anywhere in the world, either by visiting the Virtual Reality worlds of Decentraland(3) and Cryptovoxels(4), or by just browsing an online catalogue of the works. It is in the immediate goals to build a robust, and representative, collection of works and to this end the TCBA is already acquiring pieces(5) from several provenances.

2. To introduce new artists to the ecosystem, and by extension, to potential new collectors, lovers and artists. I am considering setting up a minting contract(6) to facilitate the first steps of newcoming artists (which will eventually find their own way and favorite platform). Some of the pieces minted by the TCBA will be sold(7), others will become a part of the collection.

------------------
1 - It is important to remark that the TCBA is a conceptual institution, a temporary autonomous zone created as an extension of the artistic concerns of Oficinas TK; hardly an institution in the traditional sense.

2 - By blockchain arts (which is a somewhat controversial term), I mean **original art** that has been **attached to some form of 'digital certification of origin'**. For ex. smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that mint ERC721 tokens, as the ones used by platforms like Known Origin, Super Rare, Makersplace, Mokens, Digital Art Chain and Artists Liberation Front, among others.

3- [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)

4 - [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/)

5 - Read: **'with personal funds'**, its not really an institution, its just me. This, by extent, also means that **all the pieces in the collection are mine** since I have the private keys of TCBA's collection ETH Wallet. **I will never sell these pieces**, by the way (even when they're worth 100ETH, really), and I will take all the measures to make sure the collection remains public, online and safe (the assets are stored in a Trezor One wallet).

For added transparency, you can check [OTK's address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa4ad045d62a493f0ed883b413866448afb13087c) or [TCBA's address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7CE438Bf068c8F47F0F46cB7891Fc7fD0956f117).

6 - Most probably through [Pixura](https://pixura.io/).

7 - Fees percentage, or their absence, are still being considered; either way, I have no means of implementing a solution like a multi signature wallet for now, so eventual pay outs will be made by me on a 'I really trust Oficinas TK' basis. If, and as soon as possible, a trustless solution will be implemented.
